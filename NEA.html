        Contributions:
        <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
          <li>Sole Programmer</li>
          <li>Includes a recursive algorithm to scramble a string. </li>
          <li>Database handling in SQLite: multiple, connected tables that interact with each other (Users, which contained Logins, 
            a separate table for Question banks the user had created, as well as a database for each of the users’ scores on each game) </li>
          <li>Account system: Users are able to login or create new accounts, reading and writing to a Database, which checks that there are no users with the same username. By logging in, the user is able to access information from different tables, 
            they are able to access their Questions Banks and their own highscores. </li>
          <li>Pairs: created a question and answer object from a selected question bank, 
            the user could then drag the questions or answers to the other to score points. </li>
          <li> Word scramble: Using a recursive algorithm, a country name would get scrambled and then the user would have to unscramble it, hints were also available,
             as it read from the database to find out which continent it was on and what the first letter was. </li>
          <li>Quiz: Simple question and answer, the user would select a question bank 
            and then it would randomly select questions for the user to input answers into.</li>
          <li> Question Banks: Users are able to create their own question banks, they are able to read, write, edit and delete them,
             they are stored within a database and they are given an ID which means only the user that has created them has access to it. </li>
          <li>Maps: If the database is empty, it is populated from a .txt file. Then the reader is able to select different countries from a drop down to read information about them. </li>
          <li>User Stats: A merge sort lists the top highscores of each, as well as calculating the average score for each 
            game and the percentile to compare their highest score to other users. </li>
        </ul>
